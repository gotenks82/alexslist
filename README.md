Ridiculously basic implementation of a classifieds portal... because of reasons :P

## Description
A very basic "read-only" classifieds portal built using Micronaut with server side rendering using thymeleaf and session based authentication.
This application does not aim to be a production ready app, it simply offers a base to test the integration of other backend services.

## Run
To run, execute: ./gradlew run , you can then access the app through http://localhost:8080

## Users
Example users that can login:
alex@test.com 
hannah@test.com
david@test.com
kathy@test.com
with any password.
